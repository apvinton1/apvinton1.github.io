            <p id = "aboutme"> Hi my name is Alexa Vinton and I am in 8th grade. I go to an all girls school called The Girls Middle School. I love to row, play soccer and softball. As well as sports, I
            am interested in computer science. I have been creating many websites, I created one for my entrepenurial company called xylo. I have many interests outside my normal after school programs. I enjoy to ski, explore, and play around with friends.
            But most of all I love to play with kids.
